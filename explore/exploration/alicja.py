"""Once you have chosen (and perhaps installed) the software, here is your first task:

• Download the ODI dataset from BB. ODI stands for Own Dataset Initiative.

• Load the dataset, which will be in CSV format as well as Excel, into your software. CSV
stands for comma separated values, though it is more common these days to separate
values with semi-colon (;). Nevertheless, the format is still called CSV even if the sepa-
rator is a tab character or whatever else defined by the dataset creator.

• Notice all sorts of properties of the dataset: how many records are there, how many
attributes, what kinds of attributes are there, ranges of values, distribution of values,
relationships between attributes, and so on. Notice if something is interesting (to you,
or in general), make sure you write it down if you find something worth mentioning.

• Make various plots of the data. Is there something interesting worth reporting? Re-
port the figures, discuss what is in them. What meaning do those bars, lines, dots, etc.
convey? Please select essential and interesting plots for discussion, as you have limited
space for reporting your findings (see details in a later section).
To sum up, you will need to explore the dataset, and report findings that are essential to get
an idea about the data, and also, findings that make it possible to learn something interesting
about the dataset.
